### 2. Pre-process Data
As a very first step, we take a quick look at the csv file, change columns names and save it as a delta parquet table in the same Lakehouse to the "table" section. We will use Python and therefore, from the Lakehouse at the top bar, create a new Notebook that can be utilized for typical Data Engieer tasks.

Create a Notebook

Make sure your Lakehouse "Callcenter_Lakehouse" is attached and you have PySpark (Python) selected as the language in the drop-down menu in the Home Tab options of the Notebook. On the left top corner you will see "Notebook 1" which you can rename to something more meaningful like "Callcenter Data Analysis"

Insert into the notebook cells and run the following code

```Python
#import pandas and read the call center csv file from the Lakehouse
import pandas as pd

cc = pd.read_csv("/lakehouse/default/" + "Files/Call Center Data.csv")
cc.head(5)

#renaming columns to exclude spaces
cc = cc.rename(columns= {"Incoming Calls": "incoming_calls", "Answered Calls": "answered_calls", "Answer Rate": "answer_rate", "Abandoned Calls": "abandoned_calls", "Answer Speed (AVG)": "answer_speed_avg", "Talk Duration (AVG)": "talk_duration_avg", "Waiting Time (AVG)": "waiting_time_avg", "Service Level (20 Seconds)": "servicel_level_20s"})

#drop Index column as it is unnecessary for further analysis in this case
cc = cc.drop(columns= ["Index"])

# Convert the columns with datetime information to datetime values 
cc_time = cc.copy()
cc_time[["answer_speed_avg", "talk_duration_avg", "waiting_time_avg"]] = cc_time[["answer_speed_avg", "talk_duration_avg", "waiting_time_avg"]].apply(pd.to_datetime, errors= "coerce")

#Create Spark Dataframe and write it back to the Lakehouse Tables section for PBI reporting later on
sparkDF = spark.createDataFrame(cc_time)
sparkDF.write.mode("overwrite").format("delta").save("Tables/" + "callcenter_silver")
```
Your notebook could look like this, with each block of code in a separate cell - or you can copy the entire code in just one single cell, however you like.

Verify that the file was succeffully written in the table section by clicking on the three dots next to "Tables" and hit "Refresh". 
Note: if you see a folder underneath "Table" called "Unidentified", select the 2 dots next to it and refresh it, too.
