## Step by Step guide for customer service analysis in Microsoft Fabric
### 1. Load Data 
Enter in your web browser of your choice: https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/

Data Engineers commonly use the [Fabric Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/data-factory-overview) section to ingest, prepare and transform data from various data sources and land it in Fabric OneLake. In our example, we will upload a local file directly into the Lakehouse.

To do this, navigate on the bar on your left and click on "Create" which will open up the page from where you see all items you can create in Fabric. 

Click on Lakehouse, enter the new name "Callcenter_Lakehouse", leave the "Lakehouse schema" option un-checked and click create.

In your Lakehouse, find under the Home Tab "Get Data" and select "Upload files" as shown in the screenshot below. Browse for the folder where you have stored the downloaded file from Kaggle in the prerequisite section of this tutorial and upload it to the Lakehouse. If you haven't done this yet, download [Call Center dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/satvicoder/call-center-data?resource=download) from Kaggle now.

Verify that the data is uploaded successuflly by clicking the "Refresh" icon on the top left and locate the csv file under the "Files" section. As the file is in csv format, it is stored under the "Files" section instead of the "table" section. The File section can contain various file formats like csvs, images, jsons and more. The "Table" section contains recognized delta parquet tables. To learn more about the file and table section in the Lakehouse check out the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/navigate-lakehouse-explorer#main-view-area)
